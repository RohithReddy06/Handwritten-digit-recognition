# Handwritten-digit-recognition
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Logistic Regression model. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) that are 28x28 pixels in size. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.
